# Quick Start: Using the Highlight Feature

## Step 1: Access Settings
Click the **⚙️ Settings** button in the top-right corner of the app.

## Step 2: Find Highlight Settings

2. Select a color from the dropdown (e.g., "Yellow")
3. Click **➕ Add Highlight**
4. You'll see a success notification: "Highlight added"

## Step 4: See It in Action
As transcripts are confirmed, any occurrence of your highlighted word will appear with the selected background color.

Example:

- Highlighted: "This is an **[important]** meeting" (where [important] has yellow background)

## Step 5: Manage Highlights
In the Highlight Settings section, you'll see all your active highlights:

When you export to PDF:

## Tips
- Highlights are **case-insensitive**: "Test" matches "test", "TEST", etc.
- Highlights match **whole words only**: "test" won't highlight "testing"
- Highlights are **saved automatically** in your browser
